# In this assignment I learned that when working with CSV files and pandas DataFrames how to efficiently load and manipulate large datasets using pandas. In this homework assignment, I was able to work on  filtering, grouping, and aggregating data, which are essential skills for data analysis. This was really helpful for me to practice.

# From this assignment, the most challenging aspect of this assignment was learning how to filter the data into specific conditions while keeping the analysis straightforward and easy to interpret. I used the pandas functions that were built in the break down and narrow relevant player statistics. This was challenging at first, but very satisfying to overcome. 

# I think the insights gained from analyzing ACC basketball statistics could be applied to other real-world datasets. From this homework itself, data analysis can uncover performance insights. The same techniques can be applied in business, healthcare, or other industries to make data-driven decisions. If data analysis like such can allow for basketball predictions of future games, the same analysis can be performed to make decisions to predict just about anything.
